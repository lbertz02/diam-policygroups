            <t>
                As Users connect to a network, policy applications often apply
                common policies to them. In some cases policies are grouped
                and applied through the use of AVPs, e.g. 3GPP Base Name.
                Other options include sending identifiers, usually a list of
                integers, associated with rules to apply a group to a single user.
                This compacts the over the wire representation but requires strong
                coordination between policy based Clients and Servers.
            </t>
            <t>
                Application of common policy if further limited when the filters
                overlap.  This requires partitioning policies into non-overlapping
                namespaces, e.g. tables in a Software Defined Networking (SDN) switch.
                To reduce the need to partition sets of policies some SDN technologies,
                e.g. OpenFlow, rely on metadata that is applied as part of the filter or
                metadata that is specific to the packet, e.g. OpenFlow Registers.
            </t>
            <t>
                This document defines grouping mechanisms to allow users or groups of
                users to share policies or groups of policies.  The mechanism also extends
                filters to include a metadata matching field that permits filters that overlap
                at the protocol level to coexist in the same policy enforcement space.

        <section title="Concepts">
            <t>
                Policy Groups represent a union of Policy Entities.  These entities
                MUST be of the same type, e.g. Filters <xref target="RFC7155"/> or
                Filter-Rules <xref target="RFC5777"/>.
            </t><t>
                When establishing groups and membership Sets an optional Base Name MAY
                be used.  It identifies the top level grouping.  Policy Entity groups
                MAY be directly named as well.   A Policy Entity's name MUST contain
                zero or 1 separator character '/'.  The value before the separator is
                a Base Name.  When no Base Name is provided, i.e. no separator is present.
                The value of a policy entity is considered to be part of the Base Name
                "" (empty string) for any matching purposes.  Base Name values MUST NOT
                contain the '/' character.
            </t><t>
                A Policy Entity can be applied to multiple, distinct sets of authorized
                Users.  These sets can be based upon their state (paid, past due, etc.),
                customer type (pre-paid, post-paid, etc.) or many other factors.
                In such cases, a Membership Domain is used.
            </t><t>
                Membership Domains are named domains (UTF8Strings) with binary values
                stored in bit strings to represent where the Policy Entity is used.
                A Policy Entity MAY appear in multiple Membership Domains.
            </t><t>
                Membership-Value is a compact bit pattern to be used which notes
                when a Policy Entity or Policy Group applies to to an Authorized
                User.
            </t><t>
                An Authorized User's memberships are assigned by a
                Policy-Membership.  A Policy Entity is assigned membership via
                a Membership-Assignment.   Multiple assignments may be applied
                to an Authorized User and Policy Entity but they MUST have unique
                Membership Domain values.  It is also RECOMMENDED to avoid
                numerous Policy-Membership assignments for an Authorized User as
                it delays computation of the Policy Entities that should be
                applied to their service.
            </t><t>
                Memberships are matched by understanding the relationship between
                their values which are represented as sets of bits.  These
                relationships are descibed as Match-Types and are specified as
                set relations, e.g. subset, superset, etc. <xref target="fig_refarch"/>

            <t>
                Base Names are typically assigned when a Policy Entity is
                installed on the Diameter Client.  Assignment MAY occur after
                installation but the impact of this is outside of the scope of
                this document.
            </t>
            <t>
                Membership-Assignments MAY occur at any time in the lifecycle of
                the Policy Entity.  However, there is no guarantee that resources
                exist on the Diameter Client to perform a re-evualation of the
                membership of all Authorized Users.   A Diameter Server MUST NOT
                assume that re-evaluation will occur or that an evaluation will
                occur immediately.
            </t>
            <t>
                Policy-Memberships MAY change at any time in the lifecycle of
                the Authorized User's session.  It is expected that sufficient
                resources exist to perform a re-evaluation of applicable Policy
                Entities based upon Membership testing.  If this cannot be done
                a Diameter Applicaiton level appropriate message MUST be sent to
                the Diamater Server.

            <t>
                Generally, Base-Name assignment SHOULD occur upon creation of a
                Policy Entity or the authorization of a User.
                Membership-Assignments SHOULD occur prior to an Authorized User
                being created with a Policy-Membership that would apply the
                Policy Entity to the Authorized User's session.

                    A policy administrator defines Product X with 3 separate rules sets.
                    The administrator creates the Membership-Domain "Product X" and Membership-Values 
                    of 1, 2 and 4 representing separate rule sets. For this example each rule set
                    consists of twenty Filter-Rules as defined in <xref target="RFC5777"/>.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Each Rule Set is assigned a Membership-Value. Rule Set 1 is assigned a 
                    Membership-Value of 1, Rule Set 2 members is assigned the value 2 and Rule Set 
                    three members are assigned a value of 4.  All Membership-Assignments have the 
                    Membership-Domain of "Product X" and a Match-Type of EQ (Equals). 
                </t>
                <t>
                    The policy administrator defines three users. User 1 is assigned the Membership-Domain 
                    of "Product X"" and Membership-Value of 1. User 2 is assigned a Membership-Domain of 
                    "Product X" and a Membership-Value of 2. User 3 is assigned a Membership-Domain of 
                    "Product X"" and Membership-Value of 4.

                    Accordingly, the policy administrator defines the Membership-Assignment

                    a Match-Type of OVERLAP.  Thus, any Policy-Membership whose Membership-Value

                The use of Base-Names and Membership-Domain can unintentionally
                provide user information if it is too explicit, e.g.
                "Bobs' Policies".  It is RECOMMENDED that an operator consider
                the values it assigns and ensure they provide no user or
                group speicific information.
            </t>
            <t>
                As bit and test patterns the data provided by the
                Membership-Assignment and Policy-Membership AVPs provide more
                clues between an Operator and Authorized User's policy
                relationship.  However, it is no different than if one has
                access to the information transmitted between the Diameter
                Client and Server today (if the Base-Names and
                Membership-Domains) follow the reommendations in this section.

            <t>
                In either case, access to the Diameter communications is still

                The Security Considerations of the Diameter protocol itself have been
                discussed in <xref target="RFC6733"/>.  The Diameter base protocol <xref target="RFC6733"/>
                requires that each Diameter implementation use underlying
                security; i.e., TLS/TCP, DTLS/SCTP or IPsec. Use of the AVPs
                defined in this document MUST take into consideration the security
                issues and requirements of the Diameter base protocol.
